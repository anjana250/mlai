### Background

This analysis was done in the perspective of the company that sends out coupons to driver's phones for different businesses around the city. They recently got complaints from Coffee Houses because the acceptance rate of their coupons is around 49%. The Coffee House owners are comparing their acceptance rates to the higher acceptance rates of Restaurants Under $20 and Carry Away because they are at a similar price point. Reference Figure 1. They want an analysis done on the types of customers that typically accept Coffee House coupons and target those drivers specifically.

### Business Goals and KPI
1. Get a better understanding of which customers are likely to accept a Coffee House coupon
2. Increase the acceptance rate of Coffee House coupons by targeting drivers that are more likely to accept

### Gathering and Describing Data
A Dataframe of just Coffee House coupons was created to start our analysis. The dataset consists of 3996 responses with the average age of 32 and income of $52179. The average driver who responded goes to the Coffee House about 2.4 times a week.  Also, using this dataset we were able to confirm that the proportion of people who accepted a coffee house coupon was under 50%.
